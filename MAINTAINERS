List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

If you wish to submit code, we recommend reaching out to the maintainers
first, who will attempt to steer you in the right direction.

We also request you follow these guidelines:

1. All submissions must be made under the terms of the "Developer's Certificate
   of Origin" (DC) and should include a Signed-off-by: line.

2. All Submissions should use Unix line endings for consitency with the rest of
   the XenServer project

3. Each patch should include a descriptive commit comment that helps understand
   why the patch is necessary and why it works. This will be used both for
   initial review and for new people to understand how the code works later

4. Make sure you have the right to submit any changes you make. If you do
   changes at work you may find your employer owns the patches instead of
   you.
